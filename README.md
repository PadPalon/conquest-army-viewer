# Conquest Army Viewer

My attempt at building a custom army viewer for the tabletop game
Conquest: The Last Argument Of Kings. The official army builder
is very nice, but I got lost in it a lot. This is a Me problem,
so I'm trying to build a Me solution.

The intent is to read the text export from the army builder,
combine it with the rules, and show whatever info is relevant
to me specifically.
